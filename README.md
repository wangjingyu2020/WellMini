# WellMini 🌿

**WellMini** is a very basic Qt-based desktop application designed as a starting point for experimenting with core Qt concepts. 
It includes essential features like UI layout management, page switching, system tray integration, and dialog interaction.

## ✨ Features

  Pops up a friendly reminder every 1 minutes to encourage physical breaks and eye rest.

- 🖥️ **System Tray Integration**  
  Minimizes to tray instead of exiting—double-click the tray icon to restore the app.

- 🔐 **Login Interface**  
  A simple login screen before accessing the main interface, with default credentials accepted automatically if left blank.

  Uses `QStackedWidget` to toggle between login and dashboard pages.

  Displays current user status like “admin • healthy work habits”.
